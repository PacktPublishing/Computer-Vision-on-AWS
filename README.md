**Build and deploy real-world CV solutions with Amazon Rekognition, Lookout for Vision, and SageMaker**

## What is this book about?
Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence that helps transform visual data into actionable insights to solve a wide range of business challenges. This book provides prescriptive guidance to anyone looking to learn how to approach CV problems for quickly building and deploying production-ready models.
You’ll begin by exploring the applications of CV and the features of Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Lookout for Vision. The book will then walk you through real-world use cases such as identity verification, real-time video analysis, content moderation, and detecting manufacturing defects that’ll enable you to understand how to implement AWS AI/ML services. As you make progress, you'll also use Amazon SageMaker for data annotation, training, and deploying CV models. In the concluding chapters, you'll work with practical code examples, and discover best practices and design principles for scaling, reducing cost, improving the security posture, and mitigating bias of CV workloads.
By the end of this AWS book, you'll be able to accelerate your business outcomes by building and implementing CV into your production environments with the help of AWS AI/ML services.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Apply CV across industries, including e-commerce, logistics, and media
* Build custom image classifiers with Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels
* Create automated end-to-end CV workflows on AWS
* Detect product defects on edge devices using Amazon Lookout for Vision
* Build, deploy, and monitor CV models using Amazon SageMaker
* Discover best practices for designing and evaluating CV workloads
* Develop an AI governance strategy across the entire machine learning life cycle
